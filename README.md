# KinLink
KinLink provides an open-source interface for building completely decentralysed interconnected systems with almost zero overhead.

## Why did you make it?
I could not find an existing library that provided the methods to easily connect devices of all sorts globally without a central server, so I built KinLink!

## What can KinLink do?
KinLink connects other programs running a compatible version of KinLink with a unique key present on each KinLink client/server. In fact, the KinLink client both acts as a server and a client with no requirement of port forwarding.

## How does KinLink work?
KinLink works by allowing organisations or users to transmit secure data by encrypting and/or obfuscating the data being transfered. Users of KinLink can have full control of how data is processed and managed before it reaches the standard level of encryption powered by [Zest](https://github.com/mnkrcc/zest). Data is sent with extra data to help ensure all the information has arrived correctly but these features can be disabled optionally in the interest of saving total data transfered (mobile networks in particular)

## How can I get started?
Documentation will be available soon, help others find the project by sharing it around, making changes/pull requests, and starring it!
